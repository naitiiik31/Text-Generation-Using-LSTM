# 🤖 Text Generation Using LSTM

## 📌 Overview
The Text Generation Using LSTM project uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to generate text based on input training data.  
This system learns sequential patterns and language structure from a text corpus and generates new text that resembles the style and context of the dataset.  
Users can train the model on any text dataset and generate creative sequences in real time.

## 🚀 Features
- Text generation using LSTM neural network  
- Sequence prediction based on training text  
- Works with any text corpus  
- Tokenization and sequence preprocessing

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow
- Load and read the text dataset  
- Clean and preprocess text (tokenize, lower case, remove noise)  
- Convert text to sequences for training  
- Build LSTM model with embedding layer  
- Train the model on input sequences  
- Generate new text based on seed text input
